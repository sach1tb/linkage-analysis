# linkage_analysis
Mechanism Design and Analysis (MEE 320)

Set of functions to perform linkage analysis. 

Example scripts to get started:

1) Plots a fourbar, trace in 2D, and trace against time
2) Solves a fourbar position analysis using numerical method fsolve
3) Jansen's linkage position analysis using numerical methods

TODO:
- make analysis scripts consistent for fourbar and walker legs
